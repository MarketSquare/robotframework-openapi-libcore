"""
The OpenApiLibCore package is intended to be used as a dependency for other
Robot Framework libraries that facilitate the testing of OpenAPI / Swagger APIs.
The following classes and constants are exposed to be used by the library user:
- OpenApiLibCore: The class to be imported in the Robot Framework library.
- IdDependency, IdReference, PathPropertiesConstraint, PropertyValueConstraint,
    UniquePropertyValueConstraint: Classes to be subclassed by the library user
    when implementing a custom mapping module (advanced use).
- Dto, Relation: Base classes that can be used for type annotations.
- IGNORE: A special constant that can be used as a value in the PropertyValueConstraint.
